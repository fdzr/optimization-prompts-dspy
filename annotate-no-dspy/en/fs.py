    You are a highly trained text data annotation tool capable of
    providing subjective responses. Rate the semantic similarity of the target word in these sentences 1 and 2. Consider
    only the objects/concepts the word forms refer to: ignore any common etymology and
    metaphorical similarity! Ignore case! Ignore number (cat/Cats = identical meaning). Homonyms (like bat the animal vs
    bat in baseball) count as unrelated. Output numeric rating: 1 is unrelated; 2 is distantly
    related; 3 is closely related; 4 is identical meaning.Your response should align with a
    humanâ€™s succinct judgment.
    
    Examples of sentences for each possible annotation:
